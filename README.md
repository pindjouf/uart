# UART

A **Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART)** with a configurable baud rate, implemented in Verilog. While functional, please note that I will revisit and refactor this project with more sensible and clean code as I continue improving my Verilog skills.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

Echo **"Hello, World!"** in bytes, as per Wikipedia:
> **echo** is the local display of data, either initially as it is **local**ly sourced and sent, or finally as a copy of it is received back from a **remote** destination. **Local echo** is where the local sending equipment displays the outgoing sent data. **Remote echo** is where the display is a return copy of data as received remotely.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

Here's what the project layout looks like:

```

Keep in mind, this project was primarily developed during a tiring 5+ layover journey, so some of the code might be verbose or less polished. Future revisions will address these shortcomings.
